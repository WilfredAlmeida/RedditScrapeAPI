# Reddit Scraper

This is a wrapper over the official Reddit API that returns posts from any specified subreddit.

The official API becomes overwelhming for a beginner or someone with only a minor usecase so this wrapper will be helpful.

It is a REST API with the endpoint ```/getMemes``` that returns any random 4 memes from the subreddit ```IndianDankMemes``` 

It is built using the npm package [snoowrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snoowrap)

The ideal usecase is for bots that send out memes.

Refer the ```.env.sample``` file. All the values can be obtained from the reddit API dashboard.
